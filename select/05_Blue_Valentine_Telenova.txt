Blue Valentine
A love you cannot find
When all the flowers turn to dust before your eyes
Blue Valentine
Were you crying all the time?
When all the glitter turns to ashes in the light

Replay the vows and all the words
That we spoke in the cinema inside my mind
Intoxicated with the trouble I wrote
All the heartache that I leave behind

All thesе little lies and silly games, it's all thе same to me
And how I idolise the empty highs
I try to run, I try to hide
But every time, it takes me over

Blue Valentine
A love you cannot find
When all the flowers turn to dust before your eyes
Blue Valentine
Were you crying all the time?
When all the glitter turns to ashes in the light

I thought I saw it in the trick of the light
Striking matches just to feel the spark
Flames burn a moment, all alone in the dark
In the prison of my aching heart

All these little lies and silly games
It's all the same to me
And how I idolise the empty highs

Blue Valentine
A love you cannot find
When all the flowers turn to dust before your eyes
Blue Valentine
Were you crying all the time?
When all the glitter turns to ashes in the light

I try to run, I try to hide
I try to run, I try to hide
I try to run, I try to hide
But every time, it takes me over
I try to run, I try to hide
I try to run, I try to hide
I try to run, I try to hide
But every time, it takes me over

Blue Valentine
A love you cannot find
When all the flowers turn to dust before your eyes
Blue Valentine
Were you crying all the time?
When all the glitter turns to ashes in the light

I try to run, I try to hide
I try to run, I try to hide
I try to run, I try to hide
But every time, it takes me over
I try to run, I try to hide
I try to run, I try to hide
I try to run, I try to hide
But every time, it takes me over
