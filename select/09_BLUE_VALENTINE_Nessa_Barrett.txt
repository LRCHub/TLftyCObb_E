Wrote your name in a heart
So, tell me why you carved mine into a scar?
You play it so damn cool, 'cause, baby, you are
I burn red for you
But all you ever do is make me
Blue valentine
You say that you love me
Baby, that's a lie
I'm so blue all the time
Do you really love me?
Or just love to make me cry?
Feels like nobody knows
Just how deep the darkest shades of you go
Watching while my teardrops turn into gold
Lying next to you
'Cause all you ever do is make me
Blue valentine
You say that you love me
Baby, that's a lie
I'm so blue all the time
Do you really love me?
Or just love to make me cry?
Blue valentine
Blue valentine
I'm so blue all the time
Blue valentine
