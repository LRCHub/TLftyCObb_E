She sends me blue valentines all the way from Philadelphia
To mark the anniversary of someone that I used to be
And it feels like a warrant, out for my arrest
Baby you got me checkin' in my rear view mirror
So I'm always on the run that's why I changed my name
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here

To send me blue valentines, like half forgotten dreams
Like a pebble in my shoe as I walk these streets
And the ghost of your memory, baby is the thistle in the kiss
Is the bugler that can break a roses neck
It's the tattooed broken promise, I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
I'm on a see you every time I turn my back

She sends me blue valentines though I try to remain at large
They're insisting that our love must have a eulogy
Why do I save all of this madness in the nightstand drawer?
There to haunt upon my shoulders, baby I know
I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
With this blind and broken heart that sleeps beneath my lapel

And stales this blue valentines remind me of my cardinal sin
I can never wash the guilt or get these bloodstains off my hands
And it takes a whole lot of whiskey to make this nightmares go away
And I cut my bleedin' heart out every nite
And I'm gonna die just a little more on each St. Valentine's day
Don't you remember, I promised I would write you these blue valentines
Blue valentines, blue valentines

Instead these blue valentines
To remind me of my cardinal sin
I can never wash the guilt or get these bloodstains off my hands
And it takes a whole lot of whiskey to make these nightmares go away
And I cut my bleedin' heart out every night
And I'm gonna die just a little more on each St. Valentine's day
Don't you remember, I promised I would write you
These blue valentines
Blue valentines
Blue valentines
